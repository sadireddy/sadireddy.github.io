## Summary
This assignment explored vowel biomarker analysis for intoxication detection using neural networks, reviewing recent papers and datasets to inform AI model development.

## Key Content
- **Reviewed Papers**:
  - *Vowel Space Expansion Following Alcohol Intoxication* (2024): Links vowel space changes to biomarkers.
  - *Individual Differences in Vowel Compactness* (2023): Suggests speaker-specific modeling.
  - *Alcohol Language Corpus* (2012): Provides a public dataset for alcoholized speech.
- **Reflection**:
  - Shift focus to vowel-space metrics (e.g., VSA, compactness).
  - Emphasize speaker-adaptive models to reduce errors.
  - Use public corpora for reproducible experiments.
- **Future Directions**: Explore multimodal features and cross-dataset evaluations.

## AI-Generated Insight
Incorporating speaker-specific and multimodal features enhances the robustness of AI-based intoxication detection, leveraging public datasets for reliable benchmarking.
