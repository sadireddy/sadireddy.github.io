## Summary
Summarized heuristic search techniques (e.g., A*, Greedy Best-First, Simulated Annealing), their pros, cons, and applications in pathfinding, game playing, and optimization.

## Key Content
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Heuristic Function: Estimates cost to goal (admissible, consistent).
  - State Space, Initial/Goal States, Operators, Path Cost.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Greedy Best-First: Simple but not optimal.
  - A*: Optimal, memory-intensive.
  - IDA*: Memory-efficient A* variant.
  - Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms: Vary in escaping local optima.
- **Applications**: Pathfinding, game AI, scheduling, robotics, machine learning.
